# SmartSwitch
The SmartSwitch is a input device for (local) network components realized with a [Spark.io Core ](https://www.spark.io/)<sup>1</sup> application. For further details on this project refer to our wiki here on github: [SmartSwitch WIKI](https://github.com/phhe/spark_smartswitch/wiki)


The switch can be used to submit HTTP requests on the local network. This makes it possible to control a variety of devices. Also we provide a library to control [SONOS](http://www.sonos.com/) speakers<sup>1</sup>.

Also you can use the switch with [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com)<sup>1</sup>, refer to our wiki. This enables the switch to control lots of internet enabled devices, refer to IFTTT for a complete list of possibilities.

<sup>1</sup><small>we are not associated with Spark, SONOS or IFTTT in any form. We are just two students making their homes a bit smarter</small>

## Hardware

The SmartSwitch has been designed for two Use Cases: A mobile, flexible Version with soft buttons and a wall version to be integrated below light switches in your home. The Mobile versions housing is a custom, laser cut design and the wall version is based on a GIRA System 55 actuator. You find more details in our wiki.
